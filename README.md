## Overview

The Venus River Mapper is a sophisticated Python tool designed for planetary scientists, geologists, and enthusiasts interested in simulating and visualizing hypothetical river networks on the surface of Venus. Leveraging advanced algorithms and data processing techniques, this tool transforms raw elevation data into intricate river-like patterns, providing valuable insights into the hypothetical hydrological history of Venus.

## Features

- **Advanced Simulation:** Simulates realistic river formation processes based on terrain elevation data.
- **Customization Options:** Allows users to customize river generation parameters for precise control over river networks.
- **Visualization:** Generates high-quality visualizations of the simulated river networks for analysis and presentation purposes.
- **Data Export:** Export the generated river networks to various formats for further analysis or integration with other tools.

## Installation

Follow these detailed steps to install and set up the Venus River Mapper on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python:** Version 3.x or higher installed on your system.
- **Git:** Installed to clone the repository and manage version control.

### Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to install the Venus River Mapper.
3. Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/venus-river-mapper.git
   ```

### Set Up Virtual Environment

1. Navigate into the cloned repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd venus-river-mapper
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - **Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS and Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Install Dependencies

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the Venus River Mapper

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated and you are in the project directory.
2. Run the Venus River Mapper script to start generating river networks:

   ```bash
   python complex_venus_river_mapper.py
   ```

## Usage

The Venus River Mapper offers extensive customization options to tailor the river generation process to your specific requirements. Here's a brief overview of the usage:

1. **Input Data:** Provide the input elevation data file containing the surface heightmap of Venus.
2. **Parameter Adjustment:** Fine-tune the river generation parameters in the script to control the appearance and characteristics of the simulated river networks.
3. **Execution:** Execute the script to initiate the river generation process.
4. **Visualization:** Once the generation process is complete, visualize the generated river networks using the built-in visualization tools or export the data for further analysis.
